  PURPOSE:
		To provide vim scripts with a simple tracing utility.
		
  WHY:
 		I have been working on some vim-scripts and read a lot of them
 		the last two weeks and I thought I needed a Tracing utility to
 		ease analysis of how some scripts works.
 		
  REQUIREMENT:
 		None (tested with vim/gvim 6.3 on a debian system), this script 
 		should work as a standalone plugin.
 		But I'm primarly using it with the winmanager plugin
		(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=95 ) and as such most
 		of my testing is done with this plugin integrated in the winmanager
 		workspace.
 		
  INSTALLATION:
  		Place this file in your plugin directory (~/.vim/plugin/)

  		When you start vim again and open a vim file for editing you should
  		get a message that lxTrace has installed it's documentation.
  		To get you started you could try :h lxTrace

  		If you have installed winmanager you should add LxTrace to the
  		g:winManagerWindowLayout in your vimrc file. My line looks like
  		this:
			let g:winManagerWindowLayout = 'FileExplorer,TagList|BufExplorer,LxTrace'
  		
  TIPS:
  		Documentation (when written..:o) is found at the bottom of this file. 
  		Thanks to code from vimspell.vim it should be self-installing the first
  		time this module is loaded. When installed you could try 
  			:help lxTrace
 
  NOTE:
		10 Nov 2004 (v 0.1) This is my initial upload. The module probably 
		misses functionality and has undetected bugs. So feel free to
		suggest improvements.
